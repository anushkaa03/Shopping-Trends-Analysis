Data Analysis is the technique of 
  ->collecting,
  ->transforming,
  ->and organising data
to make
  ->future predictions
  -> and informed data-driven decisions.
  -> It also helps to find possible solutions for a business problem.


Six steps for Data Analysis:
   ->  Ask or Specify Data Requirements
   ->  Prepare or Collect Data
   ->  Clean and Process
   ->  Analyze
   ->  Share
   -> Act or Report

Types of Data Analysis:
1.Descriptive- Analysing past data
2.Diagnostic - analysis explored the "why"
3.Predictive - helps in predicitve the"future course"
4.Prescriptive - helps in understanding how predicted outcomes can be used.
